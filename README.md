# FaceRecAttTrackSys (FRATS)
## About
**FRATS** is a facial recognition-based attendance system, which, as you might have noticed uses Facial Recognition technology to mark students present in the class. It aims to reduce manual work in taking attendance, eliminate proxy errors and save class time. Although, it does not save time right now, as it is in the beginning stage of it's development. But it's aim is set high, and I woul be working on it to improve it as much as I can.

Language: Python

## Libraries Used
1.  **OpenCV** - for camera work, etc.
2.  **NumPy** - Perhaps used internally by other libraries.
3.  **face_recognition** - Used for detecting, encoding and comparing faces.
4.  **json** - for storing attendance records.
5.  **fpdf** - for generating PDF of the logs.
6.  **pdf_mail** - for sending the PDF to the corresponding teacher.
